    <h3>
      A simple to make ravioli lasagana if you're meal prepping ahead of time
    </h3>
    <h4>Ingridients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Cooking Spray</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>3 cups marinara sauce, divided</li>
      <li>2 (22 ounce) packages frozen cheese ravioli</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
      <li>
        Squeeze thawed spinach between several layers of paper towels to remove
        as much excess moisture as possible. Transfer spinach to a medium bowl
        and stir in ricotta cheese, egg, salt, pepper, and garlic powder until
        well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 1 cup marinara sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
        Arrange 1/2 of the ravioli in a single layer over the sauce. Pour 1 cup
        sauce over the ravioli, then spread ricotta mixture over the sauce and
        top with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Top with remaining ravioli,
        remaining sauce, and remaining mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with parchment paper and then cover tightly with foil. Freeze for
        up to one month.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place frozen covered lasagna in the preheated oven and bake for 1 1/2
        hours. Uncover and bake until golden and bubbly, about 20 more minutes.
        Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
      </li>
